What is LinkedList ?
A linkedlist is made up of nodes where each node hold data and reference to other nodes.
# Type of LL:
1.SLL(Singly Linkedlist):
    1.Each node points to next node only.
    2.You can only move forward.
    3.Simple and use less memory.
    4.Deletion/insertion slow (next)
    Head->[10]->[20]->[30]->[40]->null

2.DLL(Doubly linkedlist):
    1.Each node points to both next and previous node.
    2.You can move forward and backward.
    3.Uses more memory due to the prev pointer.
    4.Deletion/insertion fast (prev/next)
    Head->[10]<->[20]<->[30]<->[40]->null

3.Types how can we create LL.
1.Using method (java.util.LinkedList) Real-application (low flexible)
2.Custom (class) Learning/impliment (high flexible)
