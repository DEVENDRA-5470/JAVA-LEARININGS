What is Data structure ?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing,managing and storing data in
computer memory so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

1.It defines how data is logically arranged in memory and what operations can
be performed (lke ,searching,inserting,deletion,sorting etc.)

Why important ?
The choice of right data structured directly impacts the performance of
algorithm in term space and time complexity.
------------------------------------------
Basic operations :
Insert : add ele in the structure
Delete : Remove elm form the structure
Traverse : Visit each element.
Update : Modify a data element.
Search : Find ele in the array.

1.What is array in Java ?
An array is a data structure that store a fixed-size and contigeous memory based
of the same type element.
Fixed Size.
Homogeneous.
Static Structure.
Mutability.

Operations :
Array Creation
Array indexing
Array modification
Array Traversing
Standard in-built methods.
